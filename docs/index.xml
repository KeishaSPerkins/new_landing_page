      <description>This talk is about using JavaScript to create games on the HTML5 canvas. Though you won’t create the next Halo, you’ll learn so much about JavaScript and programming as a whole when you create games with it. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to a library that’s perfect for beginners and “non-coders” alike called p5.js.
Why JavaScript? JavaScript is everywhere. If you use the internet, you’ve almost certainly encountered JavaScript.</description>

      <description>Keisha&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;Perkins is a self-taught designer and developer from Baton&amp;nbsp;Rouge, Louisiana. She works for the library by day and codes by night.
She was attracted to the front-end because of its melding of problem solving and visual design, as well as its never-ending list of things to learn.
Keisha is driven by an eagerness to create, a desire to learn, and a need to teach. Her passions have contributed to her creating curriculum for teaching the youth in her area, of which she is very proud.</description>

      <description>Here are the slides to a talk I did in February of 2018 called &#34;Using JavaScript Libraries for Game Development: An Introduction to P5.js&#34;. The talk is meant to show how the p5.js library can be used as a tool for learning JavaScript while having fun making games. The notes to this talk are also available.
