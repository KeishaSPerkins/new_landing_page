      <description>Hugo is a great static site generator that&#39;s super fast and lightweight. This talk demos the steps for getting a site up and running, adding a few posts, and choosing a theme. I really recommend digging into the HUGO docs as well as the HUGO Community Forum for more in-depth explanations of how to use HUGO for your own site. There&#39;s also a great HUGO Tutorial Playlist by Mike Dane of the Giraffe Academy YouTube channel.</description>
