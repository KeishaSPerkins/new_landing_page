Keisha&nbsp;S&nbsp;Perkins is a self-taught designer and developer from Baton&nbsp;Rouge, Louisiana. She works for the library by day and codes by night. 

She was attracted to the front-end because of its melding of problem solving and visual design, as well as its never-ending list of things to learn.

Keisha is driven by an eagerness to create, a desire to learn, and a need to teach. Her passions have contributed to her creating curriculum for teaching the youth in her area, of which she is very proud. Her work includes lesson creation with <a href="http://www.thefuturesfund.org" target="_blank">The&nbsp;Futures&nbsp;Fund</a> and developing a <a href="https://la-wit.github.io/build-an-infinite-runner" target="_blank">JavaScript&nbsp;Workshop</a> for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.la-wit.org">La-WIT</a>. Her background in communication always serves her well in these areas, as sharing with others is so integral to her passions. 

Besides teaching and volunteering, Keisha is currently working as a freelance designer and developer. <a href="../contact">Reach&nbsp;out</a> to Keisha at ksp@keishasperkins.com to connect!
