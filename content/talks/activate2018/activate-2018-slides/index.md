what: slides
---
<p>Here are the slides to a talk I did in February of 2018 called "Using JavaScript Libraries for Game Development: An Introduction to P5.js". The talk is meant to show how the <a href="http://p5js.org">p5.js</a> library can be used as a tool for learning JavaScript while having fun making games. The <a href="../activate-2018-notes">notes to this talk</a> are also available.</p>
