title: Up and Running With HUGO
what: slides
---

Hugo is a great static site generator that's super fast and lightweight. This talk demos the steps for getting a site up and running, adding a few posts, and choosing a theme. I really recommend digging into the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation">HUGO docs</a> as well as the <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io">HUGO Community Forum</a> for more in-depth explanations of how to use HUGO for your own site. There's also a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3">HUGO Tutorial Playlist</a> by Mike Dane of the Giraffe Academy YouTube channel.
